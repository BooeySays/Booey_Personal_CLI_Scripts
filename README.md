# Booeys_Personal_CLI_Scripts

### The "WHO" :
Me !!! My name is literally in the REPO's name....

### The "WHAT" :
This is just a repo that I created with the intent of filling it with all the scripts and files that I find myself using or needing everytime I am working on a new system.

I know that there are other ways of storing files, like, a USB stick, or a cloud drive... or a 1.44" floppy disc.... I don't know (I know that there are more ways, but I just got off of work and am recovering from a nasty flu that I've had for the past 3 days, so I am too brain dead to try and think of all the alternative methods), but I found that cloning a github repo was the easiest out of all the methods that I've tried.

So, I created this repo a couple of days ago, and I've been slowly adding files to it.

### The "WHERE" :
I don't know what to say for "Where"....

Maybe "https://github.com/booeysays/Booey_Personal_CLI_Scripts" ... ?

### The "WHEN" :
A couple of days ago... I'll check the exact date and update this later,..

### The "WHY" :
I've noticed that I will tend to install the same things on every new Linux system, and set all the systems up in pretty much the exact same way. I've thought about carrying a script on a USB Stick Keychain, but I work construction, and I've had horrible luck keeping a USB stick on my keychain for any lengthy period of time.

Then, about a month ago (it's currently 08-25-2018), I discovered Github. I've heard of it before.. I think I might even have gotten a free account because of some promo before...

I just never got around to using it, reading up on it, or doing anything with github.

It's really no one's fault but mine. I was just busy with school and other stuff. But anyways, I recently discovered github, and after using it a few times, I thought that it would be a perfect way for me to keep all of my small little files. Then, when I am setting up a new system, I will just clone the repo, and SHAZAMM!!! All the files I need will be there...

So... That's why this repo came to be...
